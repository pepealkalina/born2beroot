Useful Commands for Born2beroot
The basic commands we have to know and which will no doubt be very useful during the Born2beroot server’s configuration are:

exit or logout: quits the current session and returns us to the connection prompt.

su other_username: connect as a different user. 
	We will be asked for the other user’s password. 
	Running the su (switch user) command without specifying a username, 
	will let us log in as the default user, root. 
	We can exit at any time to return to the previous user session.

systemctl reboot: restarts the system (requires root permissions)

systemctl poweroff: turns off the system (requires root permissions)
